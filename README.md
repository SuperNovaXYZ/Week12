  - Character rotation based on direction
  - Bouncing idle animation
  - Movement transitions
  - Spinning animation during movement

### Level Design
- **Multiple Level Types**: Progressive difficulty with different puzzle layouts
- **Tile Types**:
  - Path tiles (wood texture)
  - Grass tiles (non-walkable)
  - Start markers
  - Goal flags
  - Collectible coins

### User Interface
- **Material Design 3**: Modern, clean interface with dynamic theming
- **Drag and Drop**: Intuitive command block placement
